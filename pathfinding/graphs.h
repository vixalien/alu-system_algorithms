 * Description:
 * All the vertices of the graph are stored in a singly linked list of vertex_t,
 * with the head pointer stored in @vertices. Each vertex has a pointer @next
 * that points to the next vertex in the list. The @next pointer does not represent
 * a connection between the two vertices. Connections between vertices are represented
 * by each vertex's singly linked list of edge_t. Each edge represents a connection
 * between the vertex and the @dest member of the edge structure. The @next member
 * of an edge points to the next edge in the linked list of edges for a given vertex.
 * Edges are unidirectional. To create a bidirectional connection between two vertices
 * A and B, create two edges: one in vertex A's edges list pointing to vertex B, and
 * another in vertex B's edges list pointing to vertex A.
